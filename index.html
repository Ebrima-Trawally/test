            A Society can simply be define as a group of people that share thesame certain aspects such as the dress code and sytles of living.
            People in thesame society have different views and which can be put together to make a difference. Let us take for an example that a brother wishes to call on a confrence to unite the people for the sake of <strong>Allah</strong>. He has to be the one to pay for all the neccessary materials to be in place but if chose to share this deed with friends in the society someone might be willing to help in other expenses and the change can happen as a group. A change can always happen in a society if the people are willing to share ideas and work towards the end with thesame goal. I am a young boy willing to work and make a difference in my society and then nation and then the world but all of this has to start with me been able to change <em>myself</em>.
